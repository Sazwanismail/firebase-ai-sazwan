# Fairbase Coin: A Fair-Launch Community Token on Base

![Fairbase Banner](https://via.placeholder.com/800x200?text=Fairbase+Coin+-+Community+Powered+Fair+Launch+Token)

## üìñ Overview

Fairbase is a community-driven cryptocurrency built on the Base blockchain, designed with true fair launch principles at its core. Inspired by Bitcoin's original vision and modern fair launch models like Yearn Finance's YFI, Fairbase eliminates pre-sales, insider allocations, and predatory tokenomics to create a truly decentralized ecosystem where all participants have equal opportunity.

## ‚ú® Key Features

- **True Fair Launch**: No pre-sales, no team allocations, no venture capital advantages
- **Transparent Tokenomics**: Fixed supply with 90% distributed through community mechanisms
- **Anti-Whale Protection**: Built-in limits to prevent concentration and manipulation
- **Community Governance**: Fully decentralized decision-making from day one
- **Low Transaction Fees**: Built on Base blockchain for affordable operations

| Development Fund | 5% | Future development and maintenance | 6-month cliff, 24-month linear |
